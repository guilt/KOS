Things OS should do
-------------------

1. Dynamic Timer to optimize for interactivity vs. throughput.
2. Dynamic Paging Enable/Disable for performance.
3. Always use fallback code for new hardware.
4. Multiple threading and execution models.
5. Multiple schedulers (I/O drives switching, CPU drives switching etc.)
6. Very low kernel footprint. Only develop kernel and exec/kexec.
   Other projects should develop the addons for the kernel.
7. Data is kernel independant. Location is outside the kernel image. This
   allows us to kexec the kernel.

Goals
-----

Simplicity, Perfect things, dynamism that can benefit long term
than laziness does - work out your ideals.

Optional Goals
--------------

1. Run 16, 32 and 64 bit code on same image.
2. Enable single data image system across cluster thereby
   encouraging highly heterogenously distributed apps.
3. Built-in Containers.
4. Multi-binary and services support.
